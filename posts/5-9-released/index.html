As for changes in upstream Swift 5.9, we recommend referring <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/swift-5.9.1-RELEASE/CHANGELOG.md#swift-59">to the official changelog</a>.</p><p>For more information about SwiftWasm in general and for getting started, please visit <a href="https://book.swiftwasm.org/">the project documentation</a>. If you have any questions, please come and talk to us on <a href="https://github.com/swiftwasm/swift/discussions">the SwiftWasm discussion forums</a> or <a href="https://github.com/swiftwasm/swift/issues/new">open an issue</a>!</p><h2>Internal build infrastructure changes</h2><p>We've made some changes to our internal build infrastructure, which should make it easier for us to track upstream Swift changes. Now GitHub <a href="https://github.com/swiftwasm/swift">swiftwasm/swift</a> repository is just for hosting our release artifacts, and we're maintaining our downstream changes in traditional <code>.patch</code> file format in <a href="https://github.com/swiftwasm/swiftwasm-build">swiftwasm/swiftwasm-build</a> repository. See <a href="https://github.com/swiftwasm/swiftwasm-build/blob/main/docs/faq.md">our rationale</a> if you're interested in the details of this decision.</p><h2>Acknowledgements</h2><p>We'd like to thank <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/swiftwasm">our GitHub sponsors</a> and <a href="https://opencollective.com/swiftwasm">OpenCollective contributors</a> for their support, which allowed us to continue working on SwiftWasm and related projects. We are displaying our gold sponsors on the README of <a href="https://github.com/swiftwasm/swift">swiftwasm/swift</a> repository. If you are already a gold sponsor and not yet listed, please <a href="https://twitter.com/kateinoigakukun">contact Yuta Saito</a> to add your appropriate logo.</p><p>We're committed to publishing transparent and open finances, so all expenses and transactions can be viewed publicly on our <a href="https://opencollective.com/swiftwasm/transactions">OpenCollective Transactions</a> page.</p><p>So far we've spent money on monthly CI bills that cover new <code>aarch64</code> CPU architecture and <a href="https://ci-external.swift.org/job/oss-swift-RA-linux-ubuntu-20.04-webassembly">community CI</a>, domain registration, email hosting, and development hardware for our maintainers.</p><p>Many thanks to <a href="https://www.macstadium.com">MacStadium</a> for giving us access to Apple Silicon hardware.</p><p>Additionally, we'd like to thank everyone who contributed their work and helped us make this release happen. These new releases wouldn't be possible without the hard work of them and the Swift community as a whole.</p></div></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
